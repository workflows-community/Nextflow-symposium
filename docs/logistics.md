## Travel Information

EMBL-EBI is located on the Wellcome Genome Campus; 10 miles (16 km) south of Cambridge, alongside the village of Hinxton. It is 30km from London Stansted airport. We are served by two local railway stations, and are situated close to Junction 10 of the M11 motorway. Full travel instructions on how to reach us can be found on the [EMBL-EBI website](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/contact).

We offer a limited shuttle bus to campus from the nearby Whittlesford Parkway rail station. The timetable can be found below. Please note that campus staff will get priority for this bus, so we cannot guarantee you will get a seat, particularly at peak times.

We encourage the use of public transport and green travel wherever possible. If you plan to get a taxi from either Cambridge, Cambridge North, Whittlesford Parkway stations, or local airports, you may wish to contact other participants from the course to travel with you. Please note it is the responsibility of the participants to organise personal travel plans and make any necessary arrangements with others.
